I co-lectured this masters level probability course in 2019. The other half was taken by Dr Belinda Spratt.

Course description: This unit introduces probability and shows you how to apply its concepts to solve practical problems. 
The unit will lay the foundations for further studies in probability, statistics and other areas of mathematics and help you 
to develop your problem-solving and modelling skills. The topics covered include: basic probability rules, conditional probability
and independence, discrete and continuous random variables, bivariate distributions, Markov chains and Poisson processes. 
This unit is appropriate for those requiring an introduction to, or a refresher in, probability. The concepts in this unit will be extended in MXN601.
