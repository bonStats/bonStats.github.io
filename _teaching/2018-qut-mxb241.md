I lectured half a semester of this second year probability course in 2018. The other half was taken by Dr Christopher Drovandi.

Course description: It is important to develop skills and knowledge in both statistics and mathematics.  
Building on the methodology and skills developed in previous studies in probability and stochastic modelling, 
this unit provides formal statistical tools such as stochastic process models and statistical methods for theoretical 
and applied development in a wide range of areas, from communication systems and networks to traffic to law to biology to 
financial analysis linking with other modern areas of mathematics.  The skills developed in mathematical statistics will be 
integral in the understanding of material throughout the student's studies in statistics and mathematical modelling.
