We provide a method for fitting monotone polynomials to data with both fixed and
random effects. In pursuit of such a method, a novel approach to least squares regression is
proposed for models with functional constraints. The new method is able to fit models with
constrained parameter spaces that are closed and convex, and is used in conjunction with
an expectation–maximisation algorithm to fit monotone polynomials with mixed effects. The
resulting mixed effects models have constrained mean curves and have the flexibility to
include either unconstrained or constrained subject-specific curves. This new methodology
is demonstrated on real-world repeated measures data with an application from sleep
science. Code to fit the methods described in this paper is available online in the R package: [gcreg](https://github.com/bonStats/gcreg).
