I'm a research statistician currently studying at Queensland University of Technology. My PhD focusses on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods.

My main areas of interest are:
- Bayesian computation
- Bayesian methods
- multilevel / hierarchical models and regularisation
- constrained non-linear regression
- election polling
- semi-infinite programming

Current projects
=====
* “Delayed-acceptance SMC” with C Drovandi and A Lee
* Bayesian addative regressiontrees for causal treatment effect models (and [R package](https://github.com/bonStats/tidytreatment))
* "Bayesian regularisation from stochastic constraints"
* "Analysing overlapping contingency tables from sensitive data" with B Baffour, M Spallek, and M Haynes
* "Bayesian computational methods for cognitive psychological models" with T Ballard
* "Semi-infinite programming in R"
