My core research is in computational statistics. I develop and analyse algorithms for __Bayesian inference__, including sequential __Monte Carlo__ and Markov chain Monte Carlo. I work with applied scientists to develop principled and robust data analysis for their data. Often this involves designing Bayesian models to incorporate domain and expert knowledge. I also design __open source__ software for statisticians, scientists and industry.

Since September 2023, I am a postdoctoral researcher supervised by Professor Christian Robert at Université Paris-Dauphine, Paris Sciences & Lettres. I am working on principled Bayesian inference algorithms with __data privacy__ guarantees. In pursuit of this goal we are developing a __framework for defining privacy__ guarantees for use in scientific, industrial and other contexts with differing privacy requirements.

In Paris I co-organise the [Mostly Monte Carlo Seminar Series](https://bonstats.github.io/mostlymontecarlo/).

In 2023 I was chair of the committe organising [SMC Down Under](https://research.qut.edu.au/qutcds/events/smc-down-under-23/).
