Research Fellow in sequential Monte Carlo methods at Queensland University of Technology.

My main areas of interest are:
- Bayesian computation
- hierarchical models
- regularisation
- constrained models

Current projects

* Monte Carlo twisted particle filters [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04288)
* Calibrating surrogates models for intractable Bayesian posteriors 
* Particle filters for binary state spaces
* BART for causal treatment effect models in social science (and [R package](https://github.com/bonStats/tidytreatment)) with S Kalucza and M O'Flaherty
