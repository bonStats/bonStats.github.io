I'm a research statistician currently studying at Queensland University of Technology. My PhD focusses on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods.

My main areas of interest are:
- Bayesian computation
- Bayesian methods
- multilevel / hierarchical models and regularisation
- constrained non-linear regression

Current projects
=====
* "Applying BART for causal treatment effect models in social science" (and [R package](https://github.com/bonStats/tidytreatment)) with S Kalucza and M O'Flaherty
* "Bayesian regularisation from stochastic constraints"
* "Bayesian computational methods for cognitive psychological models" with T Ballard
* "Semi-infinite programming in R"
