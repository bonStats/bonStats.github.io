I am a lecturer in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://adelaideuni.edu.au/about/school/mathematical-sciences/) at __Adelaide University__. I previously worked at [CEREMADE](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/en.html), Université Paris Dauphine--PSL; and the [Centre for Data Science](https://research.qut.edu.au/qutcds/) and [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.qut.edu.au/about/faculty-of-science/school-of-mathematical-sciences), Queensland University of Technology.

My research involves designing computationally __efficient__ (sometimes __private__) algorithms that learn from data with principled uncertainty quantification.

I develop and analyse algorithms for __Bayesian inference__, including sequential __Monte Carlo__ and Markov chain Monte Carlo. 
I work with applied scientists to develop __principled and robust__ analysis procedures for their data. This involves designing Bayesian models to incorporate domain and expert knowledge, and developing bespoke algorithms.
I also design __open source__ software for statisticians, scientists and industry.

I organised the [Adelaide Data Privacy Workshop](https://bonstats.github.io/AdelaideDataPrivacyWorkshop/), held in November 2025.
In Paris, I organised the [Mostly Monte Carlo Seminar Series](https://bonstats.github.io/mostlymontecarlo/). In 2023, I was chair of the [SMC Down Under](https://research.qut.edu.au/qutcds/events/smc-down-under-23/) organising committee.
