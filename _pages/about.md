I am a lecturer at Adelaide University. Previously I worked at Université Paris Dauphine--PSL, and before that at the Queensland University of Technology.

My research involves designing computationally __efficient__ (and __private__) algorithms that learn from data with principled uncertainty quantification.
I develop and analyse algorithms for __Bayesian inference__, including sequential __Monte Carlo__ and Markov chain Monte Carlo. 
I work with applied scientists to develop principled and robust data analysis for their data. Often this involves designing Bayesian models to incorporate domain and expert knowledge. 
I also design __open source__ software for statisticians, scientists and industry.

In Paris, I organised the [Mostly Monte Carlo Seminar Series](https://bonstats.github.io/mostlymontecarlo/). In 2023 I was chair of the committee organising [SMC Down Under](https://research.qut.edu.au/qutcds/events/smc-down-under-23/).
