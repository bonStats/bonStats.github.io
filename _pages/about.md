I am a lecturer at __Adelaide University__. Previously I worked at Universit√© Paris Dauphine--PSL, and before that at the Queensland University of Technology in the Centre for Data Science and School of Mathematical Sciences.

My research involves designing computationally __efficient__ (sometimes __private__) algorithms that learn from data with principled uncertainty quantification.

I develop and analyse algorithms for __Bayesian inference__, including sequential __Monte Carlo__ and Markov chain Monte Carlo. 
I work with applied scientists to develop __principled and robust__ analysis procedures for their data. This involves designing Bayesian models to incorporate domain and expert knowledge, and developing bespoke algorithms.
I also design __open source__ software for statisticians, scientists and industry.

I am organising the [Adelaide Data Privacy Workshop](https://bonstats.github.io/AdelaideDataPrivacyWorkshop/), to be held November 2025.
In Paris, I organised the [Mostly Monte Carlo Seminar Series](https://bonstats.github.io/mostlymontecarlo/). In 2023, I was chair of the [SMC Down Under](https://research.qut.edu.au/qutcds/events/smc-down-under-23/) organising committee.
